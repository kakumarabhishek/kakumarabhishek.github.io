abstract = "This paper proposes a low cost method for the estimation of blood parameters using photo-plethysmography (PPG) technique. Data is obtained non-invasively from the fingertip, which is processed to estimate the heart rate and the hemoglobin concentration. The signal received from fingertip is first processed via analog filters and the output is sent to a computer through a microcontroller interface to be processed using MATLAB in order to estimate the parameters. The proposed method can be used for health monitoring purposes in rural areas. Furthermore, this solution could be ported to work on a standalone device, thus eliminating the need for a computer."
