### Data Platform Engineering  (DPE) Team, Wipro Analytics, Wipro Ltd.
<!-- #### **Guide**: Dr. Prithwijit Guha, Assistant Professor, Department of Electronics & Electrical Engineering, IIT Guwahati -->

I worked with the DPE team on a number of PoCs for various potential clients using machine learning.

- I developed a utility for monitoring and predicting AWS EC2 instancesâ€™ usage levels with AWS CloudWatch to recommend downsizing and reserving of the instances to save on the billing costs.
- I worked on analyzing and predicting the failures in a Hadoop multi-node cluster using machine learning models for a USA based
software and hardware giant.
- I developed an automated ticket handling system for a USA based hardware and software giant using machine learning models
on the Microsoft Azure Platform.

##### **Tools used**: Jupyter Notebook, Python, R, Hadoop, AWS, Microsoft Azure, Numenta Nupic
