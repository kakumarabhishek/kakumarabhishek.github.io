### Detection of Fake Fingerprints using Minutiae Count
#### **Guides**: Dr. M K Bhuyan, Associate Professor, Department of Electronics & Electrical Engineering, IIT Guwahati

We proposed an algorithm based on the minutiae count for detecting the fake fingerprints generated using, but not limited to gelatin, Play-Doh and Silicone molds. On testing the algorithm on the FVC (Fingerprint Verification Competition) datasets, available from BioLab, University of Bologna, Italy, the algorithm achieved an accuracy of over 85%.

The results of the project have been <a href="/publication/fake-fingerprint">published</a> in the Elsevier ScienceDirect Procedia Computer Science.
